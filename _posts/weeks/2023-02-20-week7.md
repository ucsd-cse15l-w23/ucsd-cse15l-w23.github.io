# CLDQ – CSE Labs "Done Quick"

## Introduction

There are many things we can do to speed up working with the command line,
making it more efficient and easy to use. Working quickly can dramatically
change how difficult future programming tasks are for you, so it's worth
spending time getting better at using your tools.

In this lab, you’re going to learn how to make this process a lot easier for
you.  Then, you will compete in small teams against your peers to see who can
accomplish the given command line tasks most efficiently - and maybe pick up
some winners’ tricks along the way.

## Challenge Tasks

These are the tasks you will be timing yourself on. As setup, Make a fork of
[the lab 7 repo](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7) on your Github account, so
it starts as an exact copy of our repository. Before timing yourself again, make
sure to delete and re-fork the repository so you’re starting from a clean state.
The TAs were able to get under 5 minutes after a couple of tries.

So a run through this process will look like this. Don't do it just yet, though.
There's a little bit of setup involved.

1. **Setup** Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
2. **Setup** Fork the repository
3. **The real deal** Start the timer!
1. Log into ieng6
2. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
3. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
4. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
5. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
6. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account

## Github and Login Command-Line Setup

### Generating SSH Keys for ieng6

With the setup we've used so far this quarter, each time you log in to your
course-specific account, you have to type the password. You might have noticed
that during the skill demonstration you didn't have to type the password for our
instructor accounts! Here, you'll learn how to configure that for yourself (it
will save _lots_ of time).

- In your local terminal, run `ssh-keygen`
- Keep entering `<Enter>` until the program shows some text it calles the "randomart image".
  - Note the path where the public key is saved (underlined below). 
  - ![Image](../../images/ssh_keygen.png)
- Now, log into your remote course specific account on `ieng6`
- Run `mkdir .ssh` in the terminal
- Logout of your remote account
- Now, we want to copy the public SSH key you created onto your remote account,
specifically inside the `.ssh` directory you just created, in a file called
`authorized_keys`.
- Scroll up a bit to where you were creating the SSH key, find the line where it
says: `Your public key has been saved in: <path to your public SSH key>`, copy
the path. **Make sure you get the public key file, ending in `.pub`, here, not
the private file**.
- From your local computer, run `scp <path to your public SSH key> cs15lwi23__@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
  - Enter password when prompted (this will be the last time you have to type it!)
- Try to log onto your remote account again, you shouldn’t be prompted for a
password anymore. If you are, ask for help and carefully review the steps above
with your partner.

### Generating SSH Keys for GitHub

You can access and write data in repositories on GitHub.com using SSH. When you
connect via SSH, you authenticate using a private key file on your local
machine, which in our case will be the ieng6 machine. 

Create a private SSH key file in ieng6. This is a **new** private key just for
accessing Github from your course-specific account.
- Login to ieng6 as usual (hopefully, without typing a password now!)
- Run the command `ssh-keygen`, and again press Enter until the command completes and shows the "randomart image"

Next, we want to add a the public key to your **Github** account. This is like
the step of copying the public key to `authorized_keys` on `ieng6`, but instead
we're copying to Github.

- Display the SSH public key generated above to your clipboard using `cat` like
below; you can copy it by highlighting and right-clicking
  - `cat <path of your ssh key .pub file>`
- Open your Github account on the browser.
- In the upper right corner, click on your profile photo, then click **Settings**.
- In the “Access” section of the sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.
- Click **New SSH key** or **Add SSH key** under the “SSH keys” section.
- Add a “Title” to your key (ex: _Your Name_’s ieng6 machine).
- Select the “Key Type” to be an Authentication Key
- Copy your public key from the output of the `cat` command and paste it into the “Key” field
- Click **Add SSH key**.
- If prompted, confirm access to your account on Github.

Go back to the `ieng6` terminal and:	
- Run the following command to add Github.com as a recognized host (this avoids
the scary yes/no prompt about accepting new connections the first time you
connect)
  - `$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts`
  - `>>` means "append stdout of the command to file"
- Check your connection by running the following command: 
  - `$ ssh -T git@github.com`
  - It will say something like "Hi supercoolstudent1234! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."

Now we have an SSH key which can be used to authenticate to GitHub! In addition to
using `https` clone URLs, we can now use `SSH` clone URLs that look like this:

![Image](../../images/clone_with_ssh.png)

Crucially, these will allow both cloning **and** pushing to the repository (as
long as your account has access). With this done, try cloning **your fork** of
the lab 7 repository (make a fork if you didn't already), then making a small
change, and pushing it with the command line.

If you're not sure how to add, commit, and push from the command line, refer to
[the lecture video from Monday](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dlxi5vlfHKRu5v3Vwr7OMbZuINohMn1q/view).

Make sure you can make a change to your repository by editing, adding, and
pushing all from the command line before going on!

## Baseline

Before you (potentially) race against others, you are going to see how much you
can improve your own time. So you'll first take a baseline measurement of
performing the tasks above by timing yourself. Your phone may have a timer app,
or you can find one by searching for online timers. The steps from above are
duplicated here:

1. **Setup** Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
2. **Setup** Fork the repository
3. **The real deal** Start the timer!
1. Log into ieng6
2. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
3. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
4. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
5. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
6. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!) 

**Write down in notes:** What was your baseline time? Did your lab partner have
a faster baseline than you? If so, do they have any tips to help you get
started on boosting your efficiency?

## Speed Up

Now, you will explore various ways that you can speed up your work. Try all the
steps below, and find out what works best (and what doesn’t work) for you!

### Auto Completion

1. Using Bash History (up/down arrows)
    - You can use the “up” and “down” arrows to go through the history of
    commands you have executed, it makes executing the same command much easier!
    If you run the commands you care about, then log out and back in, they are
    still in the command history!
    - You can use Ctrl-R to **search** your command history. At the bash prompt,
    type Ctrl-R and then start typing part of a command – what shows up?
    Experiment with using Ctrl-R

2. Using Tab
    - You can use the Tab key to speed up typing commands in the command line in
    the following ways:
      - Start typing the first few letters of a command or path. Pressing tab
      once will autofill the rest of the line up to the point where there are
      multiple potential possibilities. If you press tab a second time, it will
      show you all of the possibilities for what it could autocomplete to. 

3. Keyboard Shortcuts while editing commands
    - More details at: [https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/shortcuts-command-line-navigation](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/shortcuts-command-line-navigation)
    - Have you had a time where you mistyped one of the commands and had to backspace all the way back to fix the problem? There’s a better way!
      - `Ctrl-U` deletes everything from the current cursor position to the beginning of the line
      - `Ctrl-K` deletes everything from the current cursor position to the end of the line
      - `Ctrl-A` goes back to the beginning of the line
      - `Ctrl-E` goes to the end of the line
      - `Ctrl-W` deletes the last word
      - `Alt-Left`/`Alt-Right` (Windows) or `Option-Left`/`Option-Right` (Mac) to move by word
      - Click the “left” or “right” arrow to go to the left/right end of any selection!

4. Quick Copy/Paste
    - Use these keyboard shortcuts to highlight text quicker:
      - Double click – selects an entire word
      - Triple click - selects an entire paragraph
      - `Alt+Shift-Left/Alt+Shift-Right` (Windows) or
      `Option+Shift-Left/Option+Shift-Right` (Mac) -  select multiple words

    - On Mac: 
      - `Command-C` to copy
      - `Command-V` to paste

    - On Windows: 
      - `Ctrl-C` to copy
      - `Ctrl-V` to paste
      - Right click to paste in Windows terminal

## New PR!

After practicing with the above, time yourself again doing the same tasks. Don't
forget to delete and re-fork the repository before timing!

**Write down in notes:** How much were you able to improve from your baseline?

## The Tournament – CSE Labs Done Quick (#CLDQ)

Now, it’s time to race your peers in small groups! By the end of lab, only one
lab group will come out on top.

![Image](../../images/tournament_hierarchy.jpg)

### Find Your Group's Champion

*Within* your group, anyone who wants to be a contestant in the CLDQ
championship should have an initial race.

Have someone start a timer and say “go” (make sure you have a fresh fork, etc,
before starting!), and race the others in your group to finish.  Whoever goes
fastest in your group will be the representative of your group in the Aisle
stage.

There are 20 total minutes for this stage. After you select the champion,
the *whole group* should work together to think of ways to speed up their
process. All members should help the champion to prepare for the
competition. Look at their preferences, and make any suggestions that you think
could speed them up even more (make sure to have them try, first). 

**Write down in notes:** Who was the champion of your team to compete in the
first round? Did you make any last minute changes to their plan before the aisle
race?

### Aisle Round

In this round, your tutor will organize you and give you the signal to start the
clock! Race against the lab group next to you.

Then, after you have the winner, the *whole aisle* should work together to
suggest improvements for the final round across lab aisles. Take 5-10 minutes to
do this.

**Write down in notes:** Who was the champion of your aisle in the
first round? Did you make any last minute changes to their plan before the aisle
race?

### Final Race

For the final round, the course staff will help organize the 2-4 champions from
the aisle for optimal comparison. Pay attention to their instructions to get set
up, and wait for their signal to get started.

The winner of each lab room will get a full pass on their second skill demo....
most likely. Not officially as a prize or anything. It's just a good signal that
they'll succeed at skill demonstrations.

### Reflect

**Write down in notes**:
- What were the strategies used by the finalists?
- How were they similar and how were they different from the strategies used by your group?
- What’s something you learned from one of the contestants outside of your group?
