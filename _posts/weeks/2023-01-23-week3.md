### To Read

- Read these two articles by Julia Evans (one summarized in a comic below):
    - [When debugging, your attitude matters](https://jvns.ca/blog/debugging-attitude-matters/)
    - [How I Got Better at Debugging](https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/22/how-i-got-better-at-debugging/)
- Read this article by John Regehr: [How to Debug](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/199)
    - You don't need to know what all the technical tools are in these readings (systems programming, CSS, divs, etc)
- From the Regehr article, focus on the vocabulary (symptom, bug, etc); from the Evans articles, focus on the vibes
- This article: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zbMVZxsI1zOBPhSsvBi4kB5dPJuxyOJh/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zbMVZxsI1zOBPhSsvBi4kB5dPJuxyOJh/view?usp=sharing)
  (Note that assigning an article doesn't necessarily mean Joe agrees with everything in it...)

## Lab Tasks

---

As usual, we publish these ahead of time, but they aren't guaranteed to be final
until the start of lab on Wednesday.

This week in lab, you will find symptoms of bugs by writing tests, and then
narrow down the actual bug.

### Setup

Make a fork of this repository (it's OK if it's public):

[https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab3](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab3)

There are a few relevant files for us:

- `ArrayExamples.java`
- `ArrayTests.java`
- `ListExamples.java`
- `LinkedListExample.java`
- `FileExample.java`

The files that end in `Example` or `Examples` have code in them with bugs for
you to find – in `ListExamples` and `ArrayExamples`, all the methods have bugs.
In `LinkedListExample` at least one of the methods on `LinkedList` has a bug. in
`FileExample`, `getFiles` has a bug. So many 🐛s!

The file `ArrayTests.java` has some _tests_ for the methods in
`ArrayExamples.java`. It uses a library called
[JUnit](https://junit.org/junit4/) to run tests using methods called
`assertEquals` and `assertArrayEquals` (and other `assert...` methods). When we
run this class with JUnit, it runs each method that has a `@Test` annotation on
it, and reports the success or failure of the `assert` calls.

Since JUnit is an external library, it requires some extra work to compile and
run. These two commands work well, and you should see output like the below when
you run them:
    
MAC USERS:
```
local $ javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
local $ java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ArrayTests
JUnit version 4.13.2
..
Time: 0.006

OK (2 tests)
```
    
WINDOWS USERS:
```
local $ javac -cp ".;lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;lib/junit-4.13.2.jar" *.java
local $ java -cp ".;lib/junit-4.13.2.jar;lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ArrayTests
..
Time: 0.006

OK (2 tests)
```

- The `*` in the first command tells `javac` to compile *all* the `.java` files
in this directory. It's a shorthand for writing them all out, so it's a useful
notation to start using now that we have several Java files to compile.
- The `-cp` command-line argument stands for "classpath". Java uses this
command-line argument to know where to look for classes. It takes paths
separated by `:`, so the first place it will look is `.`, the current directory.
After that, it will look for classes in the two `.jar` files in the `lib`
directory. A `.jar` file is like a `.zip` file of a bunch of classes, and Java
knows how to work with them.
- While you might think the `..` in the output below `JUnit` has something to do
with a path, it's actually printing a `.` for each test that runs. So if you run
hundreds of tests, you can kinda watch the progress by seeing how the dots count
up.

**Write down in notes**: Who in your group has never seen `-cp` before? Who in
your group has never seen JUnit before? Has anyone written tests in a different
way in Java? What about in a different language?

### Symptoms and Failure-inducing Inputs

#### Array Methods

The two tests we wrote for you pass, but these two reverse implementations have
bugs! Write more tests to demonstrate that the two implementations have bugs,
and identify the bugs.

**Write down in notes** – For each, what was the failure-inducing input (the
test)? What was the symptom (the output when the test failed)? What was the bug
(the problem in the code)? Be as specific as possible to fill this in: copy the
code for your tests, the output for the symptoms, and the code change you need
to make for the bug.

**Checkpoint** – After fixing the reverse methods, make a commit and push to
your repository. It's really useful to checkpoint your work this way; you will
be able to see in the commit history each of the elements above as well. See [Week 1’s Key Definitions and Related Links](https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week1/) for the basics of `git` commands, and instructions on committing and pushing on Github Desktop.

For `averageWithoutLowest`, you will do a similar process as above, making sure to note symptoms, failure-inducing inputs, and bugs. But, this time, **your lab partner will brainstorm one of the tests for you to write, describe it to you at a high level, and then you will implement it.** Complete these steps as described below.
1. Write down in notes - Come up with a high level description of a test that your lab partner should implement (without using any code!). Also include: Which symptom/bug is this testing for? Why is this test useful?
2. Implement and run the test devised by your lab partner

If you're having trouble thinking of tests, try starting from the smallest
possible inputs (an empty array), and then trying increasing sizes of arrays to
structure your thinking.

#### List Methods

There are two methods in `ListExamples`, each of which has a bug. For this
program, create **a new file** called `ListTests.java` with JUnit tests. Do the
same exercise, carefully designing your tests to get failing inputs, symptoms,
and eventually identify the bugs. Keep in mind that most of the time we can find
relatively *small* inputs that trigger the buggy behavior!

**Write down in notes** – Symptoms, inputs, and bugs.

**Checkpoint** – Commit your changes, and don't forget to add the new file! This
is one of the most common mistakes I make with `git` that is annoying for my
collaborators: I add a new file locally and forget to put it on Github for them
to see!

#### Linked List Methods

The file `LinkedListExample.java` has an implementation of a linked list that
is, in fact, buggy. We won't tell you which method(s) have the bugs. Create a
file called `LinkedListTests.java` and write tests in that file.

Note that for this case, your failure-inducing input requires a little more work
to construct: you have to build lists and try out the methods. All of that work
is part of the “failure-inducing input”, and it's useful to have it all written
down in code so that we don't have to remember it or re-type it each time we
want to run the test.

**Write down in notes** – Symptoms, inputs, and bugs.

**Reflect, write down in notes** – You've now had to create two new test files
(one for `ListExamples` and one for `LinkedListExample`). What actions did you take in
your editor to do this? How long did it take you? Could you or did you use
copy/paste effectively to avoid lots of typing? Could you or did you use the up
arrow in the terminal to “get back” earlier commands rather than typing them out
again? Any other tricks you could use to make this more painless in the future?

Discuss with your group! The long-term goal here is to learn tips and tricks to
take tasks that might be annoying 5-minute tasks and turn them into 30-second
tasks. It really changes how you think about writing tests if the process of
getting started takes less time!

**Checkpoint** – Commit your changes, and don't forget to add the new file! This
is one of the most common mistakes I make with `git` that is annoying for my
collaborators: I add a new file locally and forget to put it on Github for them
to see! (Yes, this is repeated from the last section. It's a common mistake, so
it's worth repeating!)

#### File Methods

The file `FileExample.java` has an implementation of a method that works with
the filesystem and, fortunately for our learning, it's buggy.

This one is interesting because the definition of a "failure-inducing input" is
trickier – this program won't run without us having some files and paths
available to try! So the first thing you may want to do is _create_ the example
file structure in the comment in that file in your repository! Then you can
write tests that use that file. You can create this just using VScode's "new
file" and "new folder" buttons/options.

To help you read and understand the program check out the `File` documentation here:

[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/File.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/File.html)

**Write down in notes** – Symptoms, inputs, and bugs. Remember that your input
is not just the code, but also the test files you created.

**Checkpoint** – Commit your changes, and don't forget to add the new files,
including the files you created as test input! All these files need to be a part
of the repository so that we can run the tests. (This is a particularly annoying
one to realize you missed later – the test will fail because the input data
doesn't exist!)


**Discuss** – Out of all the bugs above, which was the most interesting bug you
found? Have you ever made bugs like these yourself in your own programs? What
about having JUnit tests written might be useful one or two weeks from now?

### Extend Your Server

If you're satisfied you've found each bug along with a failure-inducing input
and a symptom for each one, try extending your server from last week (do this in
pairs or as a group).

Instead of just tracking a `List` of strings, instead have your server allow
searching through a directory of files (searching the contents of the files for
query words). Make a directory in the same directory as your code that has plain
text files in it, and return all the filenames that have contents that match the
query. Hint – use the fixed `getFiles` method in your solution!

### Bonus Activity
Let's test your knowledge of bugs and how to troubleshoot them! Add several new bugs of your choice to your code, and then have your partner try to write tests which catch the new bugs. For each of the new bugs, discuss with your partner: what is the bug's symptom? What is an example input to your program which would cause this symptom to appear?

## Week 3 Lab Report {#week3-lab-report}

As with the first lab report, you'll write this as a Github Pages page, then
print that page to PDF and upload to Gradescope. Include on your page two parts.

### Part 1

Show the code for your [Simplest Search Engine from week
2](/week/week2/#make-the-simplest-search-engine) (use a code block in Markdown).
Then, show three screenshots of using it including at least one add and one
query, showing the URL in the browser and the response on the page.

For each screenshot, describe:

- Which methods in your code are called
- What the values of the relevant arguments to those methods are, and the values
of any relevant fields of the class
- If those values change, how they change by the time the request is done processing

### Part 2

Choose two of the bugs _from different files_ above. For each, show:

- The failure-inducing input (the code of the test)
- The symptom (the failing test output)
- The bug (the code fix needed)
- Then, explain the connection between the symptom and the bug. Why does the bug
cause that particular symptom for that particular input?
