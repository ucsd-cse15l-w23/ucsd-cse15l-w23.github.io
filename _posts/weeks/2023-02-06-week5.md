## Skill Demonstration 1

This week is Skill Demonstration 1. Lab time will be replaced with attending skill demos at each student's alloted time for the examination. Head to EdStem for instructions regarding logistics and assigned tasks. You can (and should) practice these tasks ahead of time.

Also note that we will be moving/cancelling office hours *after* the first skill demo on Wednesday is hosted.
