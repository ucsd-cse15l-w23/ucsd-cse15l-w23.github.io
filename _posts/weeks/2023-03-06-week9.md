## Lab Tasks

In this lab, you'll be presented with a sequence of common debugging scenarios
that we have noticed students encountering this quarter. For each one, there's a
brief description and a screenshot. Your job is to *reproduce* the error shown
in the screenshot so that you see it on your own computer, and then describe the
fix.

For **each** of the scenarios below, you should:

1. **Write down in notes**: Discuss and confirm with your partner – what is the
**desired** or **expected** behavior, and which part of the output is wrong or
not what's expected?
2. Reproduce this behavior with your partner. If you have to, take the time to
write out exactly the command-line in a suitable repository. To reproduce, we mean
getting your terminal/editor to look as much like the one in the screenshot as
possible. It might not be possible to make it _exactly_ the same—your username
will be different, for instance—but you should see the same error message for
the same command.
3. **Write down in notes**: Take a screenshot of your reproduction and put it in
the notes, along with a description of how you reproduced it (e.g. if you first
cloned a repository, opened a terminal, and changed directory, for example).
4. **Write down in notes**: Describe how to change the commands or program to get
the _expected_ output.
5. **Write down in notes**: Have you ever made this mistake before? What was easy
or hard about noticing the error? What could you do in the future to notice or
fix it more quickly?

_(This is good practice and gives some understanding about what we do as course
staff when we see your EdStem posts!)_

One skill we're practicing here is **reproducing** bugs. In general when
reporting issues or asking questions, there's a question of
**reproducibility**: whoever is seeing the error usually doesn't have
access to your running system, so **reproducing** the possible error from the
given information is a key step. Sometimes screenshots are more helpful than
just text, because they include the Visual Studio Code file browser or other
similar visual details. Sometimes text is more helpful than a screenshot,
because it can be easily copy-pasted to try out some code on another computer.
You can always provide both to really help the person trying to reproduce the
error, which is what we do in some cases below!

### Scenario 1

Here's a screenshot of an error (right-click and "Open Image in New Tab" to see
it if it's too small).  For reference, this one was using the [lab 3 code
repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab3). The programmer was trying
to run the tests.

### Scenario 2

The repostory used is similar to this one, but pay attention to differences in
`grade.sh`:

### Scenario 3

`bug.sh` contains the following code:

```bash
VAR=7

if [[1 -eq $VAR ]]
then
  echo "it was 1"
fi
```

### Scenario 4

A project has the following file layout:

![](/images/2023-03-03-15-41-10.png)

The contents of `Code.java` is this:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class Code {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       File file = new File(args[0]);
       if (file.exists()) {
           System.out.println("File exists, yay!");
       }
       else {
           System.out.println("The file does not exist :(");
       }
   }
}
```

Then this surprising result happens (the programmer was expecting the file to
be reported as existing):
