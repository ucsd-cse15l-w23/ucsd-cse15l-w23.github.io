## Key Definitions

- **git repository**: A folder that tracks the history of edits to its files
- **Github repository**: A git repository online, like a Google Drive folder with history
- **Github pages**: A service that takes a Github repository and builds a
website from it (usually relying on conventions, like `index.md`)
- **Markdown**: A way to write plain text files with a little bit of formatting
- **commit**: A set of changes to a file or multiple files in a repository. A
repository history is made up of commits
- **git clone**: A git action to copy a repository from one place to another
(usually from somewhere like Github to our computer). Copies the contents of the
folder _and_ the entire history – the whole repository.
- **git commit**: A git action to take some changes we've made to files and
turn them into a commit in the repository's history
- **git push**: A git action to send commits from one place to another (usually
from our computer to Github)


## Lab Tasks

In this lab you'll make a professional website for yourself where you can post
your lab reports for the course. Please contact the instructor
(`jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu`) if for personal privacy or security reasons you do not
want to publish a public website, even under a pseudonym.

### Part 1 – Meet Your Group!

We will split into groups of 6-8 students for discussion. For week 1, you may sit
wherever you want and choose who you want to work with. Starting week 2, we will have
assigned seating and groups. These
groups will be somewhat stable throughout the quarter, though some small changes
will likely happen. You will have a tutor or TA assigned to your group for help
and discussion.

Your discussion leader (the tutor/TA in your lab) will share a Google Doc with
your group where you can fill in notes as you work; this document is only for
your group. Your discussion leader will _not_ take notes for you. You can have
someone volunteer to take notes or come up with a way to share the role.

**Write down in notes** In your groups, share, and note in the running notes
document (discussion leaders, you answer these as well!):

- How you'd like people to refer to you (pronounce your name/nickname, pronouns
like he/her/they, etc)
- Your major
- One of:
    - A UCSD student organization you're a member of or interested in
    - Your favorite place you've found on campus so far
    - A useful campus shortcut or trick you know
- Your answer to the following question. Discuss why you chose that answer. ![Image](../../images/rulers.png)

### Part 2 – Your CSE15L Account

Look up your course-specific account for CSE15L here:

[https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

For help on resetting your password, here is a tutorial:
[[TUTORIAL] How to Reset your Password](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit)

Follow the onscreen instructions very carefully! Have someone watch you do it if
you feel like it isn't working.

If you've reset and you're waiting a few minutes for it to take effect, feel
free to start working on later sections of the lab, 

### Part 3 – Visual Studio Code

(If you can't or don't want to use your own computer for this for any reason,
you can skip the installation step and just open VScode on one of the computers
in the lab! You can do all your work on the lab computers all quarter, no
personal laptop setup required.)

Go to the Visual Studio Code website
[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and follow the
instructions to download and install it on your computer. There are versions for
all the major operating systems, like OSX (for Macs) and Windows (for PCs).

When it is installed, you should be able to open a window that looks like this
(it might have different colors, or a different menu bar, depending on your
system and settings):

![/images/vscode.png](/images/vscode.png)

**Write down in notes**: Everyone should share a screenshot of VScode open –
help folks figure it out if it won't install. If someone gets stuck, take a
screenshot of the error message or point at which they are stuck so we can help
them figure it out later, and they can decide to keep trying (potentially with
the tutor helping) or move on.

### Part 4 – Remotely Connecting

**In Your Group for 15 minutes**

**Note**: In this section, whenever you see a chunk of code in light gray, we are specifying that the code block is running on the **remote** server. For example:
```
  $ this is a command to the remote server
```
{: .remote}

```
  $ this is a command on your own computer
```

Many courses in CSE use course-specific accounts. These are similar to accounts
you might get on other systems at other institutions (or a future job). We'll
see how to use VScode/terminal to connect to a remote computer over the Internet
to do work there.

There is a first step you need if you're on Windows: install `git` for Windows,
which comes with some useful tools we need:

[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

Once installed, use the steps in this post to set your default terminal to use
the newly-installed `git bash` in Visual Studio Code:

[Using Bash on Windows in VScode](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994)

Then, to use `ssh`, open a terminal in VScode. (Ctrl or Command + \`, or use the
Terminal → New Terminal menu option).  Your command will look like this, but
with the `zz` replaced by the letters in your course-specific account.

```
$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

(That's one, five, l (lowercase letter L, not one); the one and l look very
close in some fonts. And remember that when we write the `$`, that's not for you
to type in! It's just a convention for how we write commands.)

Since this is likely the first time you've connected to this server, you will
probably get a message like this:

```
⤇ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```

I (Joe) always say yes to these messages when I'm connecting to a new server for
the first time; it's expected to get this message in that case. If you get this
message when you're connecting to a server you connect to _often_, it could mean
someone is trying to listen in on or control the connection. This answer is a
decent description of what's going on: [Ben Voigt's
answer](https://superuser.com/questions/421074/ssh-the-authenticity-of-host-host-cant-be-established/421084#421084)

So type `yes` and press enter, then give your password; the whole interaction
should look something like this once you give your password and are logged in:

```
# On your client
⤇ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6-202.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
Password: 
```

```
# Now on remote server

Hello cs15lwi23zz, you are currently logged into ieng6-203.ucsd.edu

{: .remote}

Now your terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basement, and any
commands you run will run on that computer! We call your computer the _client_
and the computer in the basement the _server_ based on how you are connected.

If, in this process, you run into errors and can't figure out how to proceed,
ask! When you ask, take a screenshot of your problem and add it to your group's
running notes document, then describe what the fix was. If you don't know how to
take a screenshot, ask!

Remember – it is **rare** for a tutorial to work perfectly. We often have to
stop, think, guess, Google search, ask someone, etc. in order to get things to
work the way the tutorial says. I look up the right way to describe the
`(yes/no)` answer on first login all the time, for example. So you are helping
your group _learn about potential issues_ when you do this, and that's a major
learning outcome of the course! If you see someone else have an issue that you
didn't, ask why, and what might be different about what you did, or how your
environment is set up. You will learn by reflecting on this.

**Write down in notes**: When you're done, **discuss** what you saw upon login.
Take a screenshot or copy/paste the output. Did you all see the same thing? What
might the differences mean? Note the results of your discussion in the notes
document.

### Part 5 – Run Some Commands  

Try running the commands `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, and `cp` a few times in
different ways, both on **your computer**, and on the **remote computer** after
ssh-ing (use the terminal in VScode) .  Discuss in your group what you see. Can
you cause them to produce error messages? What do they mean? If you're on
Windows, what happens when you use them on Windows?

Here are some specific useful commands to try:

- `cd ~`
- `cd`
- `ls -lat`
- `ls -a`
- `ls <directory>` where `<directory>` is
`/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/cs15lwi23abc`, where the `abc` is one of the other
group members' username
- `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt ~/`
- `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt`

**Write down in notes**: Copy at least one example from each group member, with
an explanation, into your shared notes doc.

Hint: To log out of the remote server in your terminal, you can use:

- Ctrl-D
- Run the command `exit`

You can also open more terminals in VSCode (there is a little + button at the
top of the terminal window where you can create another).

### Part 6 – git, Github, and Github Pages

Having a professional portfolio website for yourself can be useful in many, many
ways. It's a useful URL to put at the top of your resume/CV where potential
employers can learn more about you.  Lots of great work in CS is published only on
someone's personal page, or is at least most accessible there.  Most CS faculty
have such a page ([just](https://roseyu.com/) [a
few](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/) [examples](http://kvaccaro.com/) [from
new](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~jensenca/OSU_ENGR/index.html) CSE
faculty), for example.

Also, journaling and logging what you've learned is a powerful tool. Writing
down what we've done and how we've done it, for an audience (real or imagined)
other than ourselves, forces us to confront lingering misconceptions and cements
what we learned in our memories. It's also simply useful to refresh your memory
later!

For these reasons, we'll spend the rest of this lab creating a personal page,
and then learning to write a blog post about what we learned.

Github ([https://www.github.com](github.com)) is a web service for storing and
sharing code, along with a huge number of services surrounding that code. It
uses a tool and protocol called `git` [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com) to store and
retrieve that code. Github Pages
[https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) is one of the services
Github provides for publishing personal and project websites from your Github
account.

This lab is a basic introduction to all of these. We will learn to use them in
more detail as the quarter goes on; learning all that git, Github, or Github
Pages has to offer could take months of practice!

### Part 7 – Creating a Website with Github Pages

This section will show you how to create a site with Github Pages that you'll
use for your lab reports.

There are written instructions with screenshots below you can follow, and also a
video version:

[CSE 15L Week 1: Github Pages
Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZqizez1Dzs&ab_channel=SamWong)

#### Make a Github Account

Go to [https://www.github.com](https://www.github.com) and create an account:

![](/images/github-signup.png)

(If you already have an account, you choose if you want to use it or create a
new one for this course).

You can choose any username you like for the account; it doesn't have to be
related to your legal or preferred name, though it can be and often is. Some
people choose names related to their name, like me (my Github account is
[jpolitz](https://github.com/jpolitz)). Others choose more abstract or whimsical
names for their accounts, just like usernames on any other service. Feel free to
do whatever feels right to you, and in any event, you can always [change it
later](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/changing-your-github-username).


#### Create a Repository

Once you've created your account, we are going to _create a new repository_ on
Github. A _repository_ is a folder or directory with an associated history of
changes that were made to the files within it. In this sense, a repository on
Github has some similarities to a folder in Google Drive; the differences are
mainly in the level of control we get in managing that history of changes.

![](/images/new-repository.png)

Name the repository `cse15l-lab-reports` (in my screenshot it looks like the
name is taken because I made it before taking the screenshot; it will be green
and OK for you). Leave the other settings as they are, and click "Create
Repository" at the bottom.

![](/images/create-repository.png)

You should see a screen like this (but with your username):

![](/images/new-repository-screen.png)

Click the "Create a new file" link (small, in blue, beneath the "Set up in
Desktop" button). Make a new file called `index.md`, and put some text in it
(whatever you like).

![](/images/hello-world-pages.png)

Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click "Commit new file". You should see
a view of your repository that now lists a file called `index.md`.

You have a public Github repository with some text in it! You can copy the link from your browser and send it to your friends and family to view!

#### Making a Pages Site

Next, click on "Settings" at the top of your repository, and then choose the
"Pages" option in the sidebar:

![](/images/settings-repo-button.png)

![](/images/github-pages-branch.png)

Choose `main` as the source for Github Pages, and click "Save".

![](/images/github-pages-link.png)


At the top it'll say “GitHub Pages source saved". Wait a bit and refresh the
page. Eventually you'll see a message that says “Your site is live at `<url
here>`.” (This can take a few minutes!) Click the link that's shown there; at
first it will say the page isn't found. Wait a few minutes, then refresh the
page.  Then you should see the text you wrote show up on a page like this:

![](/images/hello-world-page-load.png)

<!-- **Write down in notes** – everyone should be able to screenshot their page
showing the text they wrote in their `index.md`.

**Write down in notes** – Conduct the following experiment: -->

Note that in addition to seeing your file at, e.g,
[https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/](https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/),
you can also see it with `index.html` added to the end of the URL:
[https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/index.html](https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/index.html)
(Try it!).

**Do now!** Add another file to your repository with any name you choose, but
end it in the extension `.md`. Can you use this idea to see that file?

<!-- Write down what you think is happening when you commit a new file. -->

#### Editing Markdown

The `.md` extension stands for "Markdown," which is a particular text format
used for writing. There are many good documents on the web. A good cheat sheet
and explainer are here:

- [Cheat sheet](https://commonmark.org/help/)
- [What is Markdown?](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

Skim both of those documents, then try to use some of the elements described in
the cheat sheet in your `index.md` file. How do some of the different formatting
options show up when you use them? Are any surprising?

<!-- **Write down in notes** – Try all of the formatting in the “Basic Syntax” part
of the markdown cheat sheet above; everyone should screenshot their page that
uses all of these. -->

You should now have:

- A repository with at least two files (`index.md` and another one you made up)
- In one of those files, a use of each kind of basic Markdown syntax
- A page that shows the rendered version of your Markdown text at a public URL

**Congratulations** – you now know how to make a (simple), public-facing website
with basic formatting! You can share the link to your page with anyone in the
world with an internet connection, and they can see your page.

(Fun fact: [the page you are
reading](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/blob/main/_posts/weeks/2022-01-10-week2.md)
is written in Markdown and uses Github Pages!)

## Week 1 Lab Report

You’ll submit a lab report by writing a blog post about remote access, like we 
just described using Github Pages. The lab report is due Monday, January 16 by 10pm. 
See the FAQ below for common questions, including how to add images and what to submit 
to Gradescope.

You will write a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!)
about how to log into a course-specific account on `ieng6`. Your post should
include the steps you took, along with screenshots of what each step looked
like. You're free to use the screenshots you took for lab 1, or new ones.
Complete any steps you didn't complete in your group on your own.

Overall, make sure you have at least 3 screenshots, one for each of the steps
below (though more is useful, remember that this will help out your future
self). For each step include 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you
did. If for some reason you didn't do the step exactly, describe why not (maybe
your computer already had something on it, maybe the department computers worked
differently, etc).

- Installing VScode
- Remotely Connecting
- Trying Some Commands

You should complete the writing **on your own**. Feel free to ask anyone (staff
or other students are fine!) for help if you're struggling to get remote access
set up, understand commands, get your writing to show up on Github Pages, etc.
But do not get help from anyone on authoring the report itself – the writing and
screenshots **must** be your own.

You will upload your submission by publishing the page on Github Pages, then
printing the page to PDF and uploading to the Lab Report 1 assignment on
Gradescope.

### Submission FAQ

**Should I submit the Google Doc we used during the lab session for this Lab
Report Assignment?**

No, this individual lab report submission is about the screenshot tutorial
you'll put on your own Github Pages.

You need not upload the shared notes Google doc anywhere.

**How do I add images/screenshots to my lab report?**
    
In your repository, click the “add file” button and then click “upload files”. Upload 
the screenshots you want to include from your computer. Then, in the .md file you 
created for your lab report 1, you can add the images by using the `![Image](imageName.png)`
syntax as described in the markdown cheat sheet link from earlier. Replace `ImageName.png`
with whatever your image is named in your repository.
For example, in the screenshot below, I have dog.jpg in my repository so I could include 
that screenshot by typing `![Image](dog.jpg)` in my lab1.md file.
![Image](../../images/UploadingImages.png)
    
**How do I submit my Github Pages site to Gradescope?**

Visit your Github Pages website with your tutorial in a browser (Safari, Chrome, Brave, 
Firefox, Edge, etc), and use “Print” to save it to a PDF. Then, upload the PDF to the 
“Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and Filesystem” assignment on Gradescope. For example, 
if your Github Pages site has the link [https://pandrew99.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports-example](https://pandrew99.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports-example)
and you made your lab report 1 .md file called `lab1.md`, you would access it by adding `lab1.html` 
at the end, like: [https://pandrew99.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports-example/lab1.html](https://pandrew99.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports-example/lab1.html)
The format of the PDF you submit should look something like this:
![Image](../../images/cse15l-lab-reports-example.png)
    
**Can I use screenshots from the lab document we worked on together?**

Sure! If they are from your account, that's fine. If you were unable to get your
`ssh` login to complete all these steps, don't share another user's screenshots,
instead describe where you got stuck and include a screenshot of what doesn't
work.
