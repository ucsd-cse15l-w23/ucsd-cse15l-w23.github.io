**This is the page for the winter 2023 edition of the course.**

## Material and Schedule

Coming soon!

## Frequently Asked Questions

For now, this page is a placeholder and holds frequently asked questions about
the course. This site will switch to containing the official course website and
syllabus at the start of winter quarter (January 2023).

**Q: I'm also taking Math 18, or some other course whose final exam time
overlaps with CSE15L. What should I do?**

We will have scheduled oral exams in CSE15L with appointment slots.  If you
don't have the time of the final exam free due to a conflict, you just need to
be flexible in scheduling your exam some time during finals week.

**Q: Will the course have remote options?**

No. Plan to attend all lecture and lab sessions in person. Participation
policies will take into account that not all students can make it all the time,
but we will not have remote equivalents for completing lab and lecture.

**Q: Is participation required?**

Yes. A final policy will be posted by the start of the quarter with details,
but you should plan to attend both lecture and your assigned lab section every
week.

**Q: I have a question about enrollment or the waitlist.**

Check the web registration across all the sections; the course has 14 separate
lab sections, and their enrollments and waitlists are independent and
fluctuate. Contact [CSE
Advising](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-advising) for more
information on enrollment and waitlist processes.

**Q: How should I prepare for the course?**

Review Java (for example, [CSE11](https://ucsd-cse11-f21.github.io/)). Check
out some related resources like [MIT missing
semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). Get enough sleep and set up your
schedule so you can make the class and lab times. Bookmark this web site!
