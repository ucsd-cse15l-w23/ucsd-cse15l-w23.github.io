## Announcements

We will announce important events in the course through Piazza. You must have a
Piazza account and be able to receive notifications through Piazza or check it
daily.

You can join our Piazza course here: [https://piazza.com/class/l7pbb88wlepvh/](https://piazza.com/class/l7pbb88wlepvh/)

## Course Components {#components}

There are several components to the course:

- **Lab sessions**
- **Lecture sessions**
- **Weekly quizzes**
- **Lab reports/portfolio posts**
- **Skill demonstrations**

### Labs

The course's lab component is the **main part** of the course, which meets for 2
hours on Wednesdays or Thursdays. In each lab you'll switch between working on
your own, working in pairs, and participating in group discussions about your
approach, lessons learned, programming problems, and so on.

The lab sessions and groups will be led by TAs and tutors, who will note your
participation in these discussions for credit. Note that you must
**participate**, not merely **attend**, for credit.

### Lecture Sessions

Lecture sessions are on Monday and Wednesday. You can only attend the section
(12pm or 1pm) to which you are assigned. Depending how things go after the first
week or two, we might relax this and allow attendance in either section.

In each lecture, we'll have a paper handout (also available electronically). At
the end of lecture you'll have a chance submit your handout to Gradescope. You
can do this by scanning it in the Gradescope app (for iOS and Android) or
through the web interface. To get participation credit for lecture, you have to
submit a handout filled in with reasonable effort. It's fine if answers aren't
right, and some days don't have right answers. It's fine if things aren't
totally complete, and some days we won't finish everything. But it should be
obvious that you followed along and completed the exercises we did in class.

You have to submit all of these to pass the class (we'll have 18-19 in-person
lectures with handouts). If you miss class, you can submit them up until the
start of the next class for no penalty up to 10 times -- we recommend completing
them while watching the podcast. The rest of the times you have to have a
submission during the class period. We'll have TAs on hand as backup to collect
the physical paper/help you scan and submit if you have any issue submitting.

### Weekly Quizzes

Each week there will be an online, untimed, multiple-tries quiz due on
_Wednesday at noon_ (including week 1). The purpose of this quiz is to make sure
everyone has checked in on the concepts we will be using in lab on Wednesday and
Thursday. They are open for late submission until the end of the quarter, but
see grading below for how late submissions correspond to grades.

### Lab Reports/Portfolio Posts

Roughly every _two_ weeks, (weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) you will write a lab report on
work from the previous two weeks, due on Fridays. This will take the form of a
blog post on a personal site you created in the first week.  At the end of the
quarter this means you'll have a personal web site with 5 posts detailing what
you learned.

For each post, our staff will review it and either give full credit or give
feedback; you must respond to the feedback to receive full credit on your post.
We'll post specific final deadlines for this feedback with each assignment. In
general you will get a final score of 2, 1, or 0. The gradeing section below
talks about how this relates to your course grade.

### Skill Demonstrations

Twice during the quarter (week 5 and week 10), we will spend lab doing skill
demonstrations -- this course's version of exams. In the lab, you'll spend 10
minutes 1-on-1 with a staff member doing a short demonstration of using some of
the skills you've learned. You'll be given a problem to practice in advance, and
then in the demo you'll answer some questions about extending and/or modifying
the in-advance task. You can look at the skill demonstrations from previous
offerings for a sense of what tasks we assign (though we may or may not use the
same types in this offering) [[W22 demo
1]](https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/week/week5/#skill-demonstration-1) [[W22
demo 2]](https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/week/week9/#skill-demonstration-2)

Then, in place of the final exam, you can re-do one or both of these
demonstrations if you missed credit on them to make up the missed credit. The
final exam may not be exacly the same tasks, but will be similar.

You do **not** need to plan to attend the scheduled final exam slot for the
course, though we may provide that time as an option for scheduling some of the
re-do skill demonstrations.

## Grading {#grading}

Each component of the course has a minimum achievement level to get an A, B, or
C in the course. You must reach that achievement level in _all_ of the
categories to get an A, B, or C. Pluses and minuses will be given around the
boundaries of these categories at the instructor's discretion.

To pass the course, you must fully pass **both** skill demonstrations.

- **A** achievement:
    - 7 or more lab participation (there are 8 labs that aren't skill demonstrations)
    - All quizzes complete and correct, no more than 3 late
    - All but 3 handouts submitted complete, no more than 10 late
    - All 5 lab reports complete, 4 with full credit/feedback addressed
    - Passing score on **both** skill demonstrations (either initially or with the
    final make-up)
- **B** achievement:
    - 6 or more lab participation
    - 9/10 quizzes complete and correct, no more than 5 late
    - All but 5 handouts submitted, any number can be late (up to the next
    lecture)
    - All 5 lab reports complete, 3 with full credit/feedback addressed
    - Passing score on **both** skill demonstrations (either initially or with the
    final make-up)
- **C** achievement:
    - 5 or more lab participation
    - 7/10 quizzes complete and correct, submitted at any time
    - All 5 lab reports complete, at least 2 with full credit/feedback addressed
    - Over half of handouts submitted, any number can be late
    - Passing score on **both** skill demonstrations (either initially
    or with the final make-up)
