## Course Components {#components}

There are several components to the course:

- **Lab sessions**
- **Lecture sessions**
- **Weekly quizzes**
- **Lab reports/portfolio posts**
- **Skill demonstrations**

### Labs

The course's lab component meets for 2 hours on Wednesdays or Thursdays. In
each lab you'll switch between working on your own, working in pairs, and
participating in group discussions about your approach, lessons learned,
programming problems, and so on.

The lab sessions and groups will be led by TAs and tutors, who will note your
participation in these discussions for credit. Note that you must
**participate**, not merely **attend**, for credit.

If you miss lab, you'll still be held accountable for understanding the
relevant material via Skill Demonstrations and Lab Reports. You can miss 2 labs
without it impacting your grade (see [Grading](#grading) below).

### Lecture Sessions

Lecture sessions are on Monday and Wednesday. You can only attend the section
(9am or 10am) to which you are assigned. Depending how things go after the first
week or two, we might relax this and allow attendance in either section.

In each lecture, we'll have a paper handout (also available electronically). At
the end of lecture you'll have a chance submit your handout to Gradescope. You
can do this by scanning it in the Gradescope app (for iOS and Android) or
through the web interface. To get participation credit for lecture, you have to
submit a handout filled in with reasonable effort. It's fine if answers aren't
right, and some days don't have right answers. It's fine if things aren't
totally complete, and some days we won't finish everything. But it should be
obvious that you followed along and completed the exercises we did in class.

If you miss class, you can submit them up until the start of the next class as
late submissions.  We recommend completing them while watching the podcast.
We'll have TAs on hand as backup to collect the physical paper/help you scan and
submit if you have any issue submitting. See [Grading](#grading) below for the
required submissions and how that correlates with your grade.

### Weekly Quizzes

Each week there will be an online, untimed, multiple-tries quiz due on
_Wednesday at 9 am_ before class (including week 1). The purpose of this quiz is to make sure
everyone has checked in on the concepts we will be using in lab on Wednesday and
Thursday. They are open for late submission until the end of the quarter, but
see grading below for how late submissions correspond to grades.

Sometimes quizzes have associated readings or videos to supplement lecture.

### Lab Reports/Portfolio Posts

Every other Monday (of weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) you will submit a lab report on
work from the previous week or two of lab material. This will take the form of
a blog post on a personal site you created in the first week.  At the end of
the quarter this means you'll have a personal web site with 5 posts detailing
what you learned.

For each post, our staff will review it and either give full credit or give
feedback; you must respond to the feedback to receive full credit on your post.
We'll post specific final deadlines for this feedback with each assignment.

### Skill Demonstrations

Twice during the quarter (week 5 and week 10), we will spend lab doing skill
demonstrations -- this course's version of exams. In the lab, you'll spend 10
minutes 1-on-1 with a staff member doing a short demonstration of using some of
the skills you've learned. You'll be given a problem to practice in advance, and
then in the demo you'll answer some questions about extending and/or modifying
the in-advance task. You can look at the skill demonstrations from previous
offerings for a sense of what tasks we assign (though we may or may not use the
same types in this offering) [[W22 demo

## Grading {#grading}

Each component of the course has a minimum achievement level to get an A, B, or
C in the course. You must reach that achievement level in _all_ of the
categories to get an A, B, or C. Pluses and minuses will be given around the
boundaries of these categories at the instructor's discretion.

To get a B or better in the course, you must fully pass **both** skill
demonstrations.
  
To pass the course, you must pass **one of two** skill demonstrations (either
initially or with the final make-up), and have a submission/attempt for both.

- **A** achievement:
    - 6 or more lab participation (out of 8 labs that aren't skill demonstrations)
    - All 5 lab reports completed, at least 4 with full credit/feedback addressed
    - Passing score on **both** skill demonstrations (either initially or with the
    final make-up)
- **B** achievement:
    - 5 or more lab participation
    - All 5 lab reports completed, at least 2 with full credit/feedback addressed
    - Passing score on **both** skill demonstrations (either initially or
      with the final make-up)
- **C** achievement:
    - 4 or more lab participation
    - At least 3 lab reports completed, at least 2 with full credit/feedback addressed
    - Passing score on **one** skill demonstration (either initially or
      with the final make-up), with the other one attempted

Quizzes and lecture attendance increase or decrease your scores relative to
these thresholds. I don't publish an exact number for these in advance, but if
you submit all of the lecture handouts and all of the quizzes on time and
complete, that will definitely add a `+` to the grade. If you submit no lecture
handouts and no quizzes, that will definitely add a `-` to the grade. If you
submit about half and get things generally mostly correct, there will be no
modifier.

## Academic Integrity

Individual assignments describe policies specific to the assignment. Some
general policies for the course are here.

### Lab Reports and Academic Integrity

You can use code that we provide or that your group develops in lab as part of
your lab report. Your lab reports can be public. All of the *writing* in lab
reports must be your own.

You **can** use an AI assistant like ChatGPT or Copilot to help you author lab
reports or write code in this class. If you do, you are **required** to include
a section of your lab report that shows:

- The prompts you gave to ChatGPT, or the context in which you used Copilot
  autocomplete
- What its output was and how you changed the output after it was produced

This helps us _all_ learn how these new, powerful, and little-understood tools
work (and don't).

### Skill Demonstrations and Academic Integrity

Instructions for skill demonstrations will be posted a few days before the lab
in which they happen. You're free to collaborate with others on preparing for
the skill demonstration, trying things out beforehand, and so on.

You **cannot** share details of _your_ skill demonstration with others until
after you receive your grade for it.

### Quizzes and Academic Integrity

You can work on weekly quizzes with other students.
